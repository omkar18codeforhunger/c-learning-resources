Some useful resources that I encountered while learning the C language

- [Intermediate C Programming Assignments](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/asgn.int/index.html)
- [Solutions and Discussions for exercises in the K&R v2 book](https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions) (very useful to review your answers and look at other ways of solving the problems)
- [Etude in C](https://zserge.com/posts/etude-in-c/) (more related to digital sound with C)
